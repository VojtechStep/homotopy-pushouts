* Introduction

 Homotopy Type Theory [cite:@hottbook] is a logical framework built on Martin-Löf's type theory and the univalence axiom, which characterizes identity types of universes. It is inspired by the homotopy interpretation of dependent type theory, in which types are interpreted as spaces, elements of types as points in the spaces, and identifications of elements as paths between the points. Using proof assistants such as Agda [cite:@Agda], one can translate proofs in Homotopy Type Theory into programs in a programming language, engaging in an activity called "formalization". The validity of the constructions is verified by type-checking the programs.

 In this setting, one can define higher inductive types (HITs), by specifying both /point/ constructors, and higher /path/ constructors. Homotopy pushouts are examples of HITs — given type $S, A, B$ and maps $f : S → A$, $g : S → B$, we define $\typeformer{Pushout} f g$ to be the higher inductive type with point constructors

 This work focuses on homotopy pushouts \mdash specifically we provide an exposition and formalization of the descent property and flattening lemma, and use the built infrastructure to formally prove correctness of Wärn's zigzag construction of identity types of pushouts.
