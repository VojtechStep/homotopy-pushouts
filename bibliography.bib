  abstract =     {Homotopy type theory is an interpretation of
                  Martin-L\"{o}f's constructive type theory into
                  abstract homotopy theory. There results a link
                  between constructive mathematics and algebraic
                  topology, providing topological semantics for
                  intensional systems of type theory as well as a
                  computational approach to algebraic topology via
                  type theory-based proof assistants such as Coq. The
                  present work investigates inductive types in this
                  setting. Modified rules for inductive types,
                  including types of well-founded trees, or W-types,
                  are presented, and the basic homotopical semantics
                  of such types are determined. Proofs of all results
                  have been formally verified by the Coq proof
                  assistant, and the proof scripts for this
                  verification form an essential component of this
                  research.},
