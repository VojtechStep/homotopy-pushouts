  abstract =     {Homotopy type theory is an interpretation of
                  Martin-L\"{o}f's constructive type theory into
                  abstract homotopy theory. There results a link
                  between constructive mathematics and algebraic
                  topology, providing topological semantics for
                  intensional systems of type theory as well as a
                  computational approach to algebraic topology via
                  type theory-based proof assistants such as Coq. The
                  present work investigates inductive types in this
                  setting. Modified rules for inductive types,
                  including types of well-founded trees, or W-types,
                  are presented, and the basic homotopical semantics
                  of such types are determined. Proofs of all results
                  have been formally verified by the Coq proof
                  assistant, and the proof scripts for this
                  verification form an essential component of this
                  research.},

  abstract =     {The study of equality types is central to homotopy
                  type theory. Characterizing these types is often
                  tricky, and various strategies, such as the
                  encode-decode method, have been developed.We prove a
                  theorem about equality types of coequalizers and
                  pushouts, reminiscent of an induction principle and
                  without any restrictions on the truncation levels.
                  This result makes it possible to reason directly
                  about certain equality types and to streamline
                  existing proofs by eliminating the necessity of
                  auxiliary constructions.To demonstrate this, we give
                  a very short argument for the calculation of the
                  fundamental group of the circle (Licata and Shulman
                  [1]), and for the fact that pushouts preserve
                  embeddings. Further, our development suggests a
                  higher version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem,
                  and the set-truncation operator maps it to the
                  standard Seifert-van Kampen theorem (due to Favonia
                  and Shulman [2]).We provide a formalization of the
                  main technical results in the proof assistant Lean.},

  abstract =     {Homotopy Type Theory is a new field of mathematics
                  based on the recently-discovered correspondence
                  between Martin-L\"{o}f's constructive type theory
                  and abstract homotopy theory. We have a powerful
                  interplay between these disciplines - we can use
                  geometric intuition to formulate new concepts in
                  type theory and, conversely, use type-theoretic
                  machinery to verify and often simplify existing
                  mathematical proofs.Higher inductive types form a
                  crucial part of this new system since they allow us
                  to represent mathematical objects, such as spheres,
                  tori, pushouts, and quotients, in the type theory.
                  We investigate a class of higher inductive types
                  called W-suspensions which generalize
                  Martin-L\"{o}f's well-founded trees. We show that a
                  propositional variant of W-suspensions, whose
                  computational behavior is determined up to a higher
                  path, is characterized by the universal property of
                  being a homotopy-initial algebra. As a corollary we
                  get that W-suspensions in the strict form are
                  homotopy-initial.},
