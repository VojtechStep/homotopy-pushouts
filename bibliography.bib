                  type theory. Characterizing these types is often
                  tricky, and various strategies, such as the
                  encode-decode method, have been developed.We prove a
                  theorem about equality types of coequalizers and
                  pushouts, reminiscent of an induction principle and
                  without any restrictions on the truncation levels.
                  This result makes it possible to reason directly
                  about certain equality types and to streamline
                  existing proofs by eliminating the necessity of
                  auxiliary constructions.To demonstrate this, we give
                  a very short argument for the calculation of the
                  fundamental group of the circle (Licata and Shulman
                  [1]), and for the fact that pushouts preserve
                  embeddings. Further, our development suggests a
                  higher version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem,
                  and the set-truncation operator maps it to the
                  standard Seifert-van Kampen theorem (due to Favonia
                  and Shulman [2]).We provide a formalization of the

                  The mathematics suggests new principles to add to

                  the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems
                  in permitting proofs to appear as parts of
                  propositions so that the propositions of the theory
                  can express properties of proofs. There are axioms
                  for universes that link the generation of objects
                  and types and play somewhat the same role for the
                  present theory as does the replacement axiom for
                  Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is
                  based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there
                  is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to
                  be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to
                  lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses
                  Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in
                  two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it
                  can be proved that every reduction sequence starting
                  from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term
                  after a finite number of steps. The definition of
                  the notion of convertibility and the proof that an
                  arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be
                  separated because the type symbols and the terms are
                  generated simultaneously.}

                  between Martin-L\"{o}f's constructive type theory
                  and abstract homotopy theory. We have a powerful
                  interplay between these disciplines - we can use
                  geometric intuition to formulate new concepts in
                  type theory and, conversely, use type-theoretic
                  machinery to verify and often simplify existing
                  mathematical proofs.Higher inductive types form a
                  crucial part of this new system since they allow us
                  to represent mathematical objects, such as spheres,
                  tori, pushouts, and quotients, in the type theory.
                  We investigate a class of higher inductive types
                  called W-suspensions which generalize
                  Martin-L\"{o}f's well-founded trees. We show that a
                  propositional variant of W-suspensions, whose
                  computational behavior is determined up to a higher
                  path, is characterized by the universal property of
                  being a homotopy-initial algebra. As a corollary we
                  get that W-suspensions in the strict form are
